### SWITCHR

Always find yourself pressing `^+⌘+↥` and `^+⌘+↧` on github for Objective-C files
trying to toggle between the header and implementation file?

I know I do, and now it'll behave just like in Xcode!

It apparently also works on Bitbucket!

### WARNING
This has barely been tested and will probably break in many ways!

### INSTALLATION
Download the `switchr.safariextz` from [releases page](https://github.com/jurre/switchr/releases), double click it and click install.

### USAGE
Go to an objective-c `.h` or `.m` file on github and `^+⌘+↥` and `^+⌘+↧`  all day long!

*`c` and `cpp` headers and source files are currently not supported.*
